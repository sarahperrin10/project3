###  Most Popular Shows on Netflix by State 

For this project, I wanted to create an interactive graphic based on data I found regarding the most popular shows on Netflix by state. This data, compiled by HighSpeedInternet.com, was found by using Google Trends to determine the most searched Netflix shows. In order to see the data, the user must roll over the state's abbreviation on the map with their mouse. This will then display the image of the show on top of the mouse, and the show's name at the top of the page.

Aesthetically, I tried to follow Netflix's color scheme of red and black. I imported a font from Google Fonts that I also thought matched this theme. Finally, I implemented the grey background behind the map to mirror a "static television," or white noise.

Originally, I planned to click and zoom on each state to display the show's image and name. However, being unsuccessful in this, I decided to simply make the image and name larger upon rolling over the abbreviation. In my final project, I hope to tackle this problem again. In addition, when the user rolls over certain states, the other abbreviations are visible on top of the image. This is another problem I hope to correct in my final project.
